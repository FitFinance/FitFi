## 📊 CASE 2: One Accepts, One Rejects Transaction  
**Scenario**: Asymmetric response - one user commits, other doesn't
**Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

### Flow:
1. Backend matches two users
2. User1 approves transaction and stakes 0.008 tCORE2
3. User2 rejects transaction (doesn't stake)
4. Backend timeout (30s) detects only one stake
5. Backend refunds User1 completely via `refundStake()`

### Results:

3. Backend timeout (30s) detects no stakes
4. No blockchain transactions needed
5. Both users return to matchmaking pool

### Results:
- **User1 Stakes**: 0.0 tCORE2 ✅
- **User2 Stakes**: 0.0 tCORE2 ✅

## 🚀 Direct Commit Approach Validation

### ✅ All 3 Cases Handle Perfectly:

| Case | User1 Action | User2 Action | Result | Gas Cost | Platform Fee |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **1** | ✅ Accept | ✅ Accept | 🏆 Duel completed | ~159K total | 10% collected |
| **2** | ✅ Accept | ❌ Reject | 💸 Refund issued | ~127K total | 0% |
| **3** | ❌ Reject | ❌ Reject | 🔄 Back to queue | 0 gas | 0% |

### 📈 Gas Efficiency Summary:
- **Case 1**: 79,840 gas per user (highly efficient)
- **Case 2**: Only committed user pays gas, gets refunded
- **Case 3**: Zero gas cost (no blockchain interaction)

### 💰 Economic Model Validation:
