## 🚨 SECURITY REMINDER

**BEFORE DEPLOYING TO CORE TESTNET:**

1. **Replace test private key** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Current (TEST KEY - DO NOT USE):
   PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   
   # Update with your real key:
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_real_private_key_here
   ```

2. **Set real platform address** for reward collection:
   ```bash
   PLATFORM_ADDRESS=your_platform_wallet_address
   ```

3. **Fund deployment wallet** with Core testnet tokens

## 🎯 Contract Features Ready

### Core Functionality
- **Staking**: Users stake ETH for fitness duels
- **Settlement**: Automated 85% winner / 10% platform / 5% loser distribution  
- **Refunds**: Owner can refund stakes if needed
- **Security**: Protected against reentrancy attacks

### Smart Contract Functions
```solidity
stake(uint256 duelId) payable         // Stake ETH for duel
settleDuel(uint256, address, address) // Settle with reward distribution
refundStake(uint256, address)         // Emergency refund
setPlatformAddress(address)           // Update platform address
getUserStake(uint256, address) view   // Check user stake
getTotalStakes(uint256) view          // Check total duel stakes
```

## 🚀 Deploy Now

```bash
cd /home/cbof/fitfi/contracts

# Update .env with real credentials first!
nano .env

# Deploy to Core Testnet
npm run deploy:core-testnet
```

## 📁 Generated Files After Deployment

- `deployments/core_testnet-deployment.json` - Contract address & info
- `deployments/DuelStaking-ABI.json` - ABI for backend integration

## 🔧 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify contract** on Core block explorer
2. **Test with real transactions** using interaction script
3. **Integrate with backend** using deployed address & ABI
4. **Monitor first transactions** for any issues
5. **Plan mainnet deployment** with additional security fixes

## 📊 Network Configuration

- **Network**: Core Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 1115  
- **RPC**: https://rpc.test.btcs.network
- **Explorer**: https://scan.test.btcs.network/
