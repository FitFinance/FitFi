# TODO List

This is a list of tasks, features, and improvements that need to be addressed in the backend of the project. Each item is categorized by its type and includes a brief description.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Docker Compose** - Complete the docker compose file, as it is not complete.
- [ ] **Secrets.env** - Secrets.env was added to git some commits ago, but it should not be there. Remove it from git and add it to `.gitignore`.
- [ ] **Add Swagger Documentation**: Implement Swagger for API documentation to enhance developer experience and provide clear API endpoints.
- [ ] **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API and improve security.
- [ ] **Add CORS Support**: Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow or restrict resources based on the origin of the request.
